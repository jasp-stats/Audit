Efficiency technique: Separate known and unknown misstatement
==========================

In estimating the total misstatement in the population the auditor is, in theory, dealing with a part of the population misstatement that is known and a part that is unknown. The known misstatement is divided between two possible sources: the misstatement in the critical transactions and misstatement in the sample transactions. Using the *Separate known and unknown misstatement* technique you choose to extrapolate the uncertainty in your results from the sample over the unseen part of the value of the population alone. 

#### Advantage

This technique will often result in a smaller sample size than is required if the technique is not applied.

#### Cautionary note

This technique requires the assumption that the sample taints are homogeneously distributed. You will need to verify this in a post-hoc assumption check (available in the evaluation stage) that tests the correlation between the size of the taints and the size of the transaction. If this correlation does not exist, the use of this efficiency technique is justified. If this correlation is present, you cannot use this technique and will need to evaluate your sample using a different method.
