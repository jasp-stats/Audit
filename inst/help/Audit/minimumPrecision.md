Sampling objective: Obtaining a required minimum precision
==========================

The precision is a measure of how much certainty there is in the estimate of the misstatement from testing a particular characteristic of a sample at a given level of sampling risk.

#### Statistical interpretation
In the statistical analysis, the precision is represented by the difference between the estimated most likely error and the upper bound on the misstatement. 

#### Effect on procedure
By enabling this sampling objective, you are be able to plan a sample so that the difference between the estimated most likely error and the upper bound on the misstatement is reduced to a minimum percentage. 

#### When should you enable this objective?
You should enable this objective if you are interested in making an estimate of the population misstatement with a certain accuracy.

#### Effect on sample size
A lower minimum required precision will result in a higher required sample size. Vice versa, a higher minimum required precision will result in a lower required sample size.
