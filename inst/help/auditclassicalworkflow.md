The Audit Sampling Workflow
==========================

The task of an auditor is to make a judgment regarding the fairness of the presented transactions in a population, and give on opinion on whether the population as a whole contains errors that are material (lower than the set materiality). When the auditor has access to the raw population data, they can use the *audit workflow* to calculate how many samples need to be evaluated in order to meet a certain confidence in their judgment. She can then sample these transactions from the population, inspect these observations, and produce a statement about the total error in the population. The workflow guides the auditor through the audit process, making the correct choices of calculations along the way. The frequentist *audit workflow* may use the risk assessments from the *audit risk model* to adjust the required risk of finding material errors.

Workflow
-----------

The audit workflow consists of four separate stages, each with their own purpose for the analysis:
- Planning: Calculate the minimum sample size to achieve your sampling objectives with the specified confidence.
- Selection: Select the required sampling units from the population.
- Execution: Annotate the selection with your assessment of the fairness of the selected items.
- Evaluation: Make a population statement based on your annotated selection.

Useful information

#### The Audit Risk Model

When the auditor has information that indicates a low-risk profile on the population, they can use this information to reduce their required sample size via the Audit Risk Model (ARM) provided that there are no errors in the population. According to the ARM, the audit risk (AR) is a function of the inherent risk (IR), the internal control risk (CR), and the detection risk (DR). 

*AR = IR x CR x DR*

The auditor assesses inherent risk and internal control risk generally on a 3-point scale to determine the appropriate detection risk. Using the ARM and zero errors the sample size depends on the risk factor *R* and the performance materiality. The risk factor *R* is a function of the detection risk (Stewart 2012). 

*R = -ln(DR)*

The following table presents values of *R* as a function of the detection risk, provided that there are zero errors (Touw and Hoogduin 2012).

| Detection risk (%) | 1 | 4 | 5 | 10 | 14 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| R | 4.6 | 3.2 | 3 | 2.3 | 2 |

The risk factor *R* can be adjusted using the assessments of the inherent risk and the internal control risk. By default, the standard method of setting the probabilities of IR and CR is by following the table below for a detection risk of 5%:

|  | High | Medium | Low | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| R | 3 | 2 | 1 |

These values of *R* are used to set default percentages for IR and CR. The Audit module handles the following default values for IR and CR:

- High: 100%
- Medium: 60%
- Low: 36%

You can manually adjust the value of IR and CR by selecting the Custom option under the corresponding risk assessment, thus adjusting the risk factor *R*.

#### Taints

Audited items can be evaluated while incorporating the magnitude of the misstatement by calculating their taints. The taint of an item *i* is the proportional difference between that item's book value (*y*) and the item's audit (true) value (*x*). Positive taints are associated with overstatements, while negative taints occur when items are understated.

#### Sampling objectives
In order to start the analysis you must specify the objectives that have to be achieved with the sampling procedure. The sampling objectives influence the course of the procedure. They can currently be one of two objectives:
- **Test against a performance materiality:** Also called the upper error limit, the tolerable deviation rate, or the tolerable misstatement, the performance materiality is the amount established by the auditor below the normal materiality of the financial reports to decrease the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetectable misstatements exceeds the materiality of financial reports as a whole. In the statistical analysis, the performance materiality represents the upper bound of tolerable misstatement in the population to be tested. By testing against a performance materiality, you are able to plan a sample in order to collect evidence for or against the statement that the population as a whole does not contain misstatements that are considered material (i.e., are greater than the upper bound of tolerable misstatement). You should enable this objective when you want to find out whether the population contains misstatements that are greater than a certain limit (the performance materiality) using a sample of the population. A lower performance materiality will result in a higher required sample size. Vice versa, a higher performance materiality will result in a lower required sample size.
- **Obtain a required minimum precision:** The precision is a measure of how much certainty there is in the estimate of the misstatement from testing a particular characteristic of a sample at a given level of sampling risk. In the statistical analysis, the precision is represented by the difference between the estimated most likely error and the upper bound on the misstatement. By enabling this sampling objective, you are be able to plan a sample so that the difference between the estimated most likely error and the upper bound on the misstatement is reduced to a minimum percentage. You should enable this objective if you are interested in making an estimate of the population misstatement with a certain accuracy. A lower minimum required precision will result in a higher required sample size. Vice versa, a higher minimum required precision will result in a lower required sample size.

#### Audit Risk
The audit risk determines the risk that the auditor is willing to take to give an incorrect judgment with regards to the fairness of the transactions in the population. The audit risk is the inverse of the confidence of the analysis (audit risk = 1 - confidence).

- Confidence: The confidence level for your required statistical statement.

#### How would you like to evaluate your variables?
In the execution stage the auditor evaluates their selected transactions. This can be done in two ways: evaluation using audit values, or evaluation by determining whether the transactions are correct or incorrect.

- Audit values: When selected, you will have to annotate the selection with the observations' true values. When correct, fill in the exact same value as is stated in the book value of the transaction. This approach is recommended when the transactions have a monetary value.
- Correct / Incorrect: When selected, you will have to annotate the selection with an indicator for whether the observations are correct (0) or incorrect (1). This approach is recommended when your transactions do not have a monetary value.

#### Inherent risk and control risk
The assessments of the inherent risk and control risk (Audit Risk Model) can be provided here to reduce the required evidence from the test. They are mapped to probabilities according to standards, but can also be mapped according to custom preferences.

- High: 100%
- Medium: 60%
- Low: 50%
- Custom

When both risk assessments are set to High (100%) the audit risk model is not used to adjust the detection risk.

#### Expected errors
The expected errors are the tolerable errors that can be found in the sample. A sample size is calculated so that, when the number of expected errors is found in the sample, the desired confidence is retained.

*Note:* It is advised to set this value conservatively to minimize the probability of the observed errors exceeding the expected errors, which would imply that insufficient work has been done.

- Absolute: Enter your expected errors as a monetary value (e.g., $1.000 in a total balance of $1.000.000).
- Relative: Enter your expected errors as a percentage relative to the total size of the selection.

#### Explanatory text
Enables explanatory text throughout the workflow to help you interpret the statistical results and procedure.

#### Planning distribution
The statistical distribution that is used for calculating the required sample size.

- Binomial: The infinite population binomial distribution for complete taints.
- Poisson: The poisson distribution for broken taints (AICPA, 2017).
- Hypergeometric: The finite population hypergeometric distribution (only correct/incorrect evaluation).

#### Sampling units
In statistical sampling, each sampling unit receives a probability to be included in the selection. The sampling units determine which units (individual monetary units vs individual transactions) receive a probability.

- Monetary unit sampling: Assigns inclusion probabilities on the level of individual sampling units. This method is preferred when you are investigating overstatements only.
- Record sampling: Assigns inclusion probabilities on the level of individual transactions. This method is preferred when you are looking at overstatements and understatements, or when you do not have monetary units in your population.

#### Selection method
The selection method determines how transactions are selected from the population. Different selection methods have different properties and might result in different transations in your selection.

- Random sampling: Performs random selection in which each sampling unit receives an equal probability.
- Cell sampling: Performs interval selection with randomness. Any observation that is larger than twice the interval will be selected multiple times.
- Fixed interval sampling: Performs interval selection while selecting the first observation of each interval. Any observation that is larger than the interval will be selected multiple times.

#### Seed
Random number generator seed to make results reproducible. This influences which samples are drawn from the population in random sampling and cell sampling. In fixed interval sampling the seed is disabled because the first unit from each interval is selected.

#### Estimation method
The estimation method determines how the results from your sample are extrapolated to the population.

- Binomial: Uses the binomial likelhood to evaluate the sample.
- Poisson: Uses the Poisson likelhood to evaluate the sample.
- Hypergeometric: Uses the hypergeometric likelhood to evaluate the sample.
- Stringer: The Stringer bound to evaluate the sample (Stringer, 1963).
    - LTA adjustment: LTA adjustment for the stringer bound to incorporate understatements (Leslie, Teitlebaum, & Anderson, 1979).
